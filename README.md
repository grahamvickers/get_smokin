# Node-Express Server with MongoDB

With this application I have created a food recipe and blog website, my assignment was to create a node-express server to display content from a Mongodb database and display contents and pass multiple API enpoints. The content that is being passed through is recipe data that contains titles, about, prices, imagery and more. Users can click through the endpoint and reveal more data as you move through the directory.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing

You will need to install the following in order to run the website:

copy and paste the following into your terminal: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/grahamvickers/node_express
```

#### Deployment 

Then open the project folder in a terminal of your choice, then copy and paste the following and go.
```
$ docker-compose up
```
Then go to - [localhost:3002](https://localhost:3002) - in a web broswer of your choice and start searching recipes!
