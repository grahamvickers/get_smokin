That's why you have me, I'm going to tell you what charcoal is the best on the mark and why, so here are my current top 3. #3 - Fogo Charcoal, Fogo has some of the biggest chunks of charcoal in bags on the market, but with such large pieces it can take longer to ignite. #2 - Big Green Egg Charcoal, a smooth soft smoke that gives off great flavour and the pieces are a great size to ignite in under 10 minutes! #1 - Royal Oak Charcoal, the most well rounded charcoal on the market today! I've been using the product the most with my BGE and I couldn't be happier using them, great flavour and smoke you really can't go wrong with!"
